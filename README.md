### Superstore Sales Analysis Project

Problem Statement:
As a sales manager at Superstore Sales, you received sales data across multiple regions in Canada. The company needed to identify which product subcategories were generating high profits and which were causing losses. Without this insight, resources could be wasted on underperforming products, impacting overall profitability.

### Task:

Analyze sales and profit data by product subcategory and region.

Identify top-performing and loss-making subcategories.

Use Excel tools like Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting, and Segmentation techniques to summarize and visualize the data.

Provide actionable recommendations for business strategy, such as discontinuing low-profit products or optimizing marketing and inventory.

### Results / Insights:

Top-performing subcategories: Stationery, Binders, and Copiers contributed the highest profits consistently across regions.

Loss-making subcategories: Tables, Chairs, and Fasteners showed recurring losses due to low sales and high costs.

Certain regions (e.g., East and Central Canada) consistently outperformed others, while some regions contributed to heavy losses in specific product categories.

Customer purchasing patterns showed that high-value customers mainly purchased office supplies and technology-related products.

### Key Takeaways:

Focus on high-profit subcategories for inventory prioritization and marketing campaigns.

Consider discontinuing or redesigning loss-making product subcategories.

Tailor regional strategies based on performance trends to maximize profitability.

Using Excelâ€™s Pivot Tables and Conditional Formatting, business stakeholders can quickly identify trends and make data-driven decisions without advanced analytics tools.
